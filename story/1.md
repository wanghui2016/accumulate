The best things can come from the worst experiences
最糟糕的经历却让人有最美好的体验
Once, when I was in Sicily（西西里岛）, I was swindled （欺骗）by a stranger for a hundred dollars. At first I was devastated（非常震惊的）. I spent the entire next day thinking about what I should have done to keep my money, and what I would do if I had it. But what I learned from this about humanity（人性）, about the nature of good and evil within people, and how circumstances force them to do bad things showed me a lot about myself and how to cope with misfortune.
有一次我在西西里岛，被一个陌生人骗走了一百美元。起初我非常震惊，第二天，我一整天都在想如果不让骗子成功得逞的话，我应该怎么做。但从这件事情上，我学到的关于人性、关于人们的性本善和性本恶、关于环境迫使人去做坏事，都让我对自己审视良多，已经让我知道了如何应对不幸。

Seeing how other people live
观察别人是如何生活的
We’re all part of a human family, but it’s easy to forget that when we move through our daily routine（日常工作）,seeing people who live just like we do. But when you see people going about their daily existence in ways very different from your own, it can open your eyes to how similar you are to them, and how different.
我们都是人类大家庭的一部分，但在日常生活中我们很容易忘记这点，看到大家的生活和我们的生活别无二致。但你会看到那里的人们的日常生存方式，与自己的生存方式还是大不一样，可以开阔你的眼界，你和他们是那样的相似却又大不相同。

Appreciatingwhat you have
感激自己所拥有的一切
